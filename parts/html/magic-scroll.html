    <!-- Magic Scroll (mystery hack)
      Scroll down one pixel on page load and reload events.  
      
      Without this feature, the page dimensions are calculated as if URL bar
      is absent.  The URL bar is present, so there is vertical over-scroll the
      height of the URL bar.  
      
      With this feature, the page dimensions are calculated with the URL bar
      accounted for.
